Revision history for Text-vFile-toXML

0.01    2006-12-25T12:35-0600
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    2007-03-26T21:50-0600
        Fixed license in META.yml; removed tmp files from MANIFEST (oops).

0.03    2007-04-07T12:47-0500
        Fixed LICENSE in Makefile.PL (instead of META.yml, where it gets
        overwritten).

0.04    2007-12-28T16:10-0600
        Added some tests to make Devel::Cover happy; moved to Module::Install.
        No functionality changes (as far as I know!).

0.05    2017-06-24T11:04-0700
        Mend incorrect test-time dependency on insignificant XML element order,
        most probably caused by hash order changes.
